	There are many examples included! Look in the â€œLeanTween/LeanTweenExamples" folder to see many of the methods outlined.

LeanTween and Windows Store
	Hashtables are not supported for Windows Store publishing. So to pass optional values, make sure to do so in this format:

	LeanTween.moveX(gameObject, 1f, 1.5f).setDelay(1f).setEase(LeanTweenType.easeInOutQuad);
